## Overview
Invocable actions, also known as dynamic actions, can be invoked from Flows, Processes and a common endpoint in the REST API. 

Salesforce administrators have the aforementioned declarative tools at their disposal, but currently only have a primitive ability to send emails. These custom Apex email actions provide the following additional capabilities:

- **Available anywhere [@invocable methods](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_annotation_InvocableMethod.htm) can be invoked.** Examples are Lightning Flow Builder and Process Builder.
- **Save as Activity.** Save a reference to the email as an activity feed item for a specified target object.
- **Flexible recipients.** In additional to "To" recipients, send carbon copies (CC) and/or blind carbon copies (BCC).
- **Lightning Email Templates.** Upgrade from Classic Email Templates to the newer Lightning Email Templates which allows global headers and footers.
- **Include attachments.**  Attach Document, ContentVersion, or Attachment items to the email.
- **Other options.** Control [other](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_email_outbound_single.htm#apex_Messaging_SingleEmailMessage_constructors) email options.
